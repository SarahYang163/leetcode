									<p>Testing for quality assurance (QA) is a fundamental and essential component of
										software development. Not only is it necessary to ensure that all the critical
										elements of software projects are in place to be delivered on schedule, but it
										also contributes to raising the project&#8217;s overall quality. This reasons
										why QA candidates need to have a strong understanding of various concepts and be
										able to answer tricky questions.&nbsp;Imagine being asked tough
										<strong>QA interview questions</strong>. Testing your skills on such QA
										interview questions and getting zero marks can be pretty hard. Don&#8217;t
										worry. Although it is not as bad as it sounds, you will still have to face a few
										tricky QA testing interview questions that won&#8217;t be easy to answer. To
										help you in this matter, we have listed below a list of 30 tricky QA interview
										questions that will be enough for you to prepare for any job interview in the
										coming year or perhaps even later!</p>

									<h3 id="1-what-is-quality-assurance">
										<span id="1_What_is_Quality_Assurance"><strong>1. What is Quality Assurance?</strong></span>
									</h3>



									<p>Quality assurance aims to ensure that the generated software complies with all
										the requirements and specifications in the SRS document.</p>



									<h3 id="2-how-is-quality-assurance-different-from-software-testing">
										<span id="2_How_is_Quality_Assurance_different_from_Software_testing"><strong>2. How is <a href="https://testsigma.com/blog/testing-vs-quality-assurance-vs-quality-control-whats-the-difference/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Quality Assurance different from Software testing</a>?</strong></span>
									</h3>



									<p>Quality Assurance confirms that the developed software complies with all
										specifications, including SRS, FRS, and BRS. It is a deliberate testing process
										evaluation method to increase the production of high-quality goods. QA develops
										strategies to avert potential bugs during the software development process. It
										focuses mainly on management-related topics, such as project analysis,
										checklists, and development processes and techniques.</p>



									<p>Software testing is a method of investigating a system to see how it functions
										and look for potential flaws. The product is tested using various techniques to
										identify bugs and determine if they have been removed.</p>



									<h3 id="3-define-the-purpose-of-qa-in-software-development">
										<span id="3_Define_the_purpose_of_QA_in_Software_Development"><strong>3. Define the purpose of QA in Software Development.</strong></span>
									</h3>



									<p>QA&#8217;s Roles And Responsibilities:</p>



									<ul>
										<li>Defining test objectives and the strategy for achieving them.</li>
										<li>Developing a test strategy based on the specifications and timelines of the
											project.</li>
										<li>Executing tests using the appropriate methods (manually or with test
											execution tools) and recording test failures.</li>
										<li>Determining the root cause by analyzing the flaws.</li>
										<li>Repairing flaws, so they don&#8217;t compromise the quality of the final
											output.</li>
										<li>Reporting software flaws to developers using a bug tracking system (e.g.,
											Bugzilla, Mantis, QA Touch). Early testing to remove deficiencies at an
											early stage lowers the cost and duration of bug fixes.</li>
									</ul>



									<h3 id="4-what-is-the-lifecycle-of-a-quality-assurance-process">
										<span id="4_What_is_the_lifecycle_of_a_Quality_Assurance_Process"><strong>4. What is the lifecycle of a Quality Assurance Process?</strong></span>
									</h3>



									<p>QA follows a PDCA lifecycle:</p>



									<p><strong>i. Plan</strong></p>



									<p>The organization specifies the procedures needed to create a software product of
										the highest caliber during the planning phase of the Quality Assurance process.
									</p>



									<p><strong>ii. Do</strong></p>



									<p>Do is a stage in which the procedures are developed and tested.</p>



									<p><strong>iii. Check</strong></p>



									<p>This stage is intended to monitor the operations and determine whether they
										adhere to the users&#8217; needs.</p>



									<p><strong>iv. Act</strong></p>



									<p>The Act is a step in putting the necessary procedures into action.</p>

										<span id="6_Explain_What_is_Build_and_Release_Differentiate_Between_Them"><strong>6. Explain What is Build and Release. Differentiate Between Them.</strong></span>
									</h3>



									<p>Build:</p>



									<ul>
										<li>The development team provides the test team with a &#8220;build.&#8221;</li>
										<li>The test team may reject it if any tests fail or a &#8220;build” does not
											satisfy the requirements.&nbsp;</li>
										<li>Multiple builds comprehend to a single release.</li>
									</ul>



									<p>Release:</p>



									<ul>
										<li>&nbsp;A product&#8217;s official release to customers is called a
											&#8220;release.&#8221;</li>
										<li>Customers receive a build when it has been &#8220;released” after being
											tested and approved by the test team.</li>
									</ul>



									<h3 id="7-what-do-you-understand-about-bug-leakage-and-bug-release">
										<span id="7_What_Do_You_Understand_About_Bug_Leakage_and_Bug_Release"><strong>7. What Do You Understand About Bug Leakage and Bug Release?</strong></span>
									</h3>



									<p>Bug leakage:</p>



									<ul>
										<li>A bug leak occurs when the bug is missed in previous builds or versions of
											the application.</li>
										<li>A bug leakage is a fault that happens while testing but is discovered later
											by the tester or end-user.</li>
									</ul>



									<p>Bug release:</p>



									<ul>
										<li>A bug release occurs when a specific software version is released with
											several known bugs or defects. Usually, the Release Notes make mention of
											these bugs. These bugs are frequently of low priority and low
											severity.&nbsp;</li>
										<li>When the business can afford it, it is decided to leave the bug in the
											deployed software rather than spend time and money correcting it in that
											specific version.</li>
									</ul>



									<h3 id="8-what-do-you-mean-by-monkey-testing">
										<span id="8_What_Do_You_Mean_by_Monkey_Testing"><strong>8. What Do You Mean by Monkey Testing?</strong></span>
									</h3>



									<p>In software development, The effectiveness of an application is tested through
										monkey testing. &#8220;Monkey testing&#8221; involves a tester randomly
										inputting data into the program with no intention of crashing it. By supplying
										arbitrary inputs and attempting to break the program, it is appropriate for load
										testing.&nbsp;</p>



									<p>Some flaws might not always be discovered using conventional methods at regular
										intervals. These problems are more likely to be found if random inputs are
										provided. This method is used to uncover bugs not typically encountered by
										conventional methods and is applied to the entire system.</p>



									<h3 id="9-what-do-you-mean-by-gorilla-testing">
										<span id="9_What_Do_You_Mean_by_Gorilla_Testing"><strong>9. What Do You Mean by Gorilla Testing?</strong></span>
									</h3>



									<p>Gorilla testing meticulously tests every last bit of code until it fails using
										arbitrary inputs, whereas the resilience of an application is tested rigorously
										by hand.&nbsp;</p>



									<p>The main difference between Gorilla and Monkey testing is that the former tests
										specific modules, whereas the latter evaluates the entire system. Random valid
										and invalid inputs are supplied into each product&#8217;s modules until a module
										crashes.</p>



									<p>This phase is carried out for each module in the last phases of the software
										development cycle to test the robustness of the application. It is also known as
										&#8220;torture testing&#8221; or &#8220;fault tolerance testing&#8221; because
										it is rigorous.</p>



									<h3 id="10-explain-testware">
										<span id="10_Explain_Testware"><strong>10. Explain Testware.</strong></span>
									</h3>



									<p>Testware refers to the artifacts created during the testing process needed to
										plan, design, and carry out tests.&nbsp;</p>



									<p>Documentation, scripts, inputs, anticipated outcomes, setup and teardown methods,
										files, databases, environments, and other software or utilities needed in
										testing are considered testware.</p>



									<p>Testware is considered a testing tool that is adequately saved and controlled by
										a configuration management tool.</p>



									<p>Testware differs from regular software in two ways:</p>



									<ul>
										<li>It is created by testers for a specific objective.</li>
										<li>It has multiple users and various quality measures.</li>
									</ul>



									<h3 id="11-what-is-a-traceability-matrix">
										<span id="11_What_is_a_traceability_matrix"><strong>11. What is a traceability matrix?</strong></span>
									</h3>



									<p>The Traceability matrix is a specific kind of document used in software
										development projects to track, identify, and confirm the development of a
										particular capability or component. Aids in connecting and tracing business,
										application, security, and other requirements to their execution, testing, or
										completion. It assesses and compares various system components and gives
										information on the state of the project&#8217;s needs in terms of their degree
										of completion.</p>



									<p>A worksheet-style document with a table typically serves as a traceability
										matrix. An identifier for one group is placed in the top row, and an
										identification for the other set is placed in the left column to compare the two
										sets of values. A mark is made if there is a similarity or a connection.</p>

									</h3>



									<p><strong>Retesting:</strong></p>



									<p>Retesting is a technique to verify particular test cases discovered to have bugs
										in the final execution. Testers typically find these defects as they test a
										software program, then they are given to developers to remedy. The developers
										then fix the bugs and provide them back to the testers for validation. Retesting
										is the name of this ongoing procedure.</p>



									<p><strong>Regression testing:</strong></p>



									<p>Regression testing validates if a code update has negatively affected the
										application&#8217;s current features and functions.</p>



									<ul>
										<li>Regression testing is conducted on passed test cases, whereas retesting is
											only performed on failed test cases.</li>
										<li>While retesting verifies that the initial flaw has been fixed, regression
											testing looks for unanticipated side effects.</li>
										<li>Unlike Regression testing, retesting includes defect verification.</li>
										<li>Retesting is planned to test, whereas regression testing is called generic
											testing.</li>
										<li>Automation makes it possible to perform regression testing but not
											retesting.</li>

									<p>Sometimes, as project managers or project leads, we may have to cancel testing to
										launch the product sooner. In those circumstances, we must determine whether the

									<p>When deciding when to halt testing in real-time projects, various considerations
										must be taken into account:</p>



									<ul>
										<li>If the testing or release deadlines are met.</li>
										<li>By entering the determined test case pass rate.</li>
										<li>If the risk in the real-time project is below the permitted level.</li>

										<span id="25_Differentiate_Between_Load_Testing_And_Stress_Testing"><strong>25. Differentiate Between Load Testing And Stress Testing.</strong></span>
									</h3>



									<p>The purpose of each is what makes a difference:</p>



									<p>Through load testing, you can learn how a system responds to a predicted load.
									</p>



									<p>Stress testing enables you to comprehend the maximum loads at which a system can
										function.</p>



									<p>In other words, stress tests show you how a system might respond to heavy demand,
										such as a DDoS attack, the Slashdot effect, or different scenarios. In this
										manner, you might be ready for unforeseen occurrences.&nbsp;</p>



									<p>On the other hand, load tests ensure you fulfill user expectations, such as
										service level agreement (SLA) obligations. So instead of breaking the
										application, the objective is to guarantee a satisfactory overall user
										experience. It enables you to deploy new code with assurance.</p>

									<p>Adhoc testing has the following traits:</p>



									<ul>
										<li>It is done on an application after formal testing is finished.</li>
										<li>Its primary goal is to malfunction the program without a predetermined

										have a thorough program knowledge.</p>



									<p>The following is a list of the distinctions between exploratory testing and
										ad-hoc testing:</p>



									<ul>
										<li>Adhoc testing is testing software without reference to requirements
											documents or specifications. Exploratory testing entails understanding the
											software and investigating the application.</li>
										<li>In Adhoc testing, documentation is not necessary. In exploratory testing,
											documentation is required.</li>
										<li>Adhoc testing&#8217;s primary goal is to refine the testing process.
											Learning about the application is the primary goal of exploratory testing.
										</li>
										<li>Adhoc testing is a non-formal approach, while exploratory testing is a

									</h3>



									<p><strong>i. New,</strong></p>



									<p>The status of a new defect, is set to New when it is initially logged and posted.
									</p>



									<p><strong>ii. Assigned</strong></p>



									<p>After the tester posts a bug, the tester&#8217;s lead reviews the bug and
										designates it for the developing team.</p>



									<p><strong>iii. Open</strong></p>



									<p>The developer gets to work on the defect fix and analysis.</p>



									<p><strong>iv. Fixed</strong></p>



									<p>A developer may mark an issue as fixed once the required code modifications have
										been made and verified.</p>



									<p><strong>v. Retest</strong></p>



									<p>The tester retests the code to see if the developer has fixed the issue. If not,
										then the status is changed to retest.</p>



									<p><strong>vi. Reopen</strong></p>



									<p>Once the developer has fixed the bug, but it still exists, the tester switches
										the status to Reopen, and the bug runs through the bug life cycle.</p>



									<p><strong>vii. Verified</strong></p>



									<p>After the developer has corrected the bug, the tester retests it; if no bugs are
										discovered, the status is changed to Verified.</p>



									<p><strong>viii. Closed</strong></p>



									<p>The status is changed to Closed if the bug is no longer present.</p>



									<p><strong>ix. Duplicate</strong></p>



									<p>The status is changed to Duplicate if the defect occurs twice or if it shares the
										same concept as the prior problem.</p>



									<p><strong>x. Rejected</strong></p>



									<p>The status is changed to Rejected if the developer believes the flaw is not
										there.</p>



									<p><strong>xi. Deferred</strong></p>



									<p>If the bug can be patched in the upcoming release and does not have a higher

									</h3>



									<p>Software testing generally employs Defect Triage, commonly referred to as Bug
										Triage. It is necessary to describe the faults&#8217; importance and
										seriousness. The severity of a problem is determined by how it affects the
										application being tested.</p>



									<p>Priority is the sequence in which a flaw must be corrected or resolved. Defect
										triage is essentially a method that aims to rebalance the process, which is
										typically problematic for the test team due to a lack of necessary resources.
										Defects are usually prioritized in defect triage based only on their severity,
										likelihood of recurrence, and risk.</p>

									</h3>



									<p>The terms &#8220;stub” and &#8220;drivers” in software testing refer to a copy of
										the modules that replace new or absent modules.</p>



									<p>Drivers are primarily used in bottom-up integration testing individually and
										created to improve the testing process. Stubs are used mainly in top-down
										integration testing.</p>



									<p>The critical difference between them:</p>



									<p>1. Stubs are used in top-down integration testing, while drivers are employed in
										bottom-up integration testing.</p>



									<p>2. Stubs are an imitation of the <em>called function</em> in code. A section of
										code mimics a <em>calling function&#8217;s</em> behavior as a driver.&nbsp;</p>



									<p>3. Stubs encourage the development of unfinished and missing modules. Drivers
										invoke test modules and pass test cases to other code.</p>



									<p>4. Stubs are considered when lower-level modules are under the developing
										process, and high-level modules are tested. Drivers are considered when
										lower-level modules are tested, but higher-level ones haven’t yet been created.
